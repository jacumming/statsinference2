# PRACTICAL 1-2: Sampling and Simulation
# ---------------------------------
#
#
# In this practical, we introduce the ideas of statistical simulation as a mechanism
# to investigate the behaviour of sampling distributions in a case study problem
# of jury selection. We'll expand our R techniques to see how to write custom 
# functions, to sample and generate random numbers, and how to repeat straightforward
# calculations an arbitrary number of times.



 # *  You will need the following skills from previous practicals:
 #    *   Basic R skills with arithmetic, functions, etc
 #    *   Manipulating and creating vectors: `c`, `seq`,
 #    *   Calculating data summaries: `mean`, `sd`, `var`, `min`, `max`
 #    *   Plotting a histogram with `hist`
 # *  New R techniques:
 #    *   Sampling from a vector using `sample`
 #    *   Generating random numbers from a binomial distribution using `rbinom`
 #    *   Creating new functions with `function`
 #    *   Using `replicate` to repeatedly call a function with no arguments
 #    *   Adding straight lines to plots with `abline`




#
#
# 1. Jury selection: Swain vs. Alabama (1965)
# ==================================================================================
#
# The context of our problem today is concerns the selection of a jury in a trial
# in 1965 Alabama, USA. In the early 1960s, in Talladega County in Alabama, a Black
# man called Robert Swain was convicted and was sentenced to death. At the time, 
# only men aged 21 or older were allowed to serve on juries in Talladega County, 
# where 26% of the eligible jurors were Black. Of the 100 jurors available in the 
# jury panel, only 8 were Black and no Black man was selected for the jury of the
# actual trial itself.

# Robert Swain appealed his sentence, citing among other factors the fact the jury
# at his trial was all White. Moreover, he pointed out that all Talladega County 
# jury panels for the past 10 years had contained only a small percent of Black 
# panelists. Robert Swain was represented in the U.S. Supreme Court by Constance 
# Baker Motley (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constance_Baker_Motley), the first 
# African-American woman to argue a case in that Court. She argued 10 cases in the
# Supreme Court and lost only one – Robert Swain's. The U.S. Supreme Court concluded,
# "the overall percentage disparity has been small" and that there was insufficient
# evidence of "invidious discrimination".
# 
# But was this assertion reasonable? If jury panelists were selected at random 
# from the county’s eligible population, there would be some chance variation. We
# wouldn’t get exactly 26 Black panelists on every 100-person panel. But would we
# expect as few as eight? In this practical, we will use statistical simulation to
# investigate how plausible such an outcome would be, given the composition of the
# wider population of potential jurors.




#
#
# 2. Simulation and sampling 
# ==================================================================================
#
# Statistical simulation - or the Monte Carlo method(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method)
# is a statistical technique where we artificially generate ("simulate") data in 
# order to explore sampling distributions, investigate the behaviour of statistical
# methods, and test hypotheses. These methods are particularly useful when the
# corresponding mathematical calculations are difficult or even impossible. Of 
# course, since our results are a product of how we set up the simulation we must
# take particular care in setting up the problem and interpreting what we find.
# 
# For this practical, we will use R and a bit of statistical thinking to examine 
# the disparity between the 8 out of 100 Black men in the jury panel, the 
# distribution of the actual jury, and the distribution in the population.


#
# 2.1 Simulating a jury
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 
# 
# We're going to approach the problem as follows:
#   
# * Let $X_i$ be one of the $n=100$ potential jurors in the panel 
# * Then $X_i=1$ if that juror is Black and $X_i=0$ otherwise
# * The jury panel comprises $n=100$ individuals are selected at random and 
#   representatitvely from the population.
# * Thus we assume that $X_i$ is drawn from a distribution where $P[X_i=1]=0.26$ to 
#   represent the 26% of eligible Black people in the local population.
# * $10$ people from the 100-person jury panel are then selected to be on the trial
#   jury.
# 
# Under these assumptions, we can *simulate* or *randomly generate* possible jury 
# panels consistent with random selection from this population. If the panel were 
# truly selected at random then our simulated results should be close to those 
# observed in Swain's case. If the results of our simulation are not consistent 
# with the composition of the panel in the trial, that will be evidence against 
# our model assumptions (ie the model of random selection) and potential evidence
# of bias. 
# 
# To begin with, we will simulate a jury using the `sample` function:



# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
# ^ TECHNIQUE: 
# ^ 
# ^ The `sample` function allows us to take a sample of a specified size from a 
# ^ vector of values which is treated as the population. The sample function has the
# ^ following syntax, which you can find by typing `?sample`:
# ^ 
# ^ `sample(x, size, replace = FALSE, prob = NULL)`
# ^ 
# ^ The arguments to this function are:
# ^   
# ^   * `x` a vector of values representing the population to be sampled
# ^   * `size` the size of sample to take - in our case this is $n$
# ^   * `replace` - whether to sample with replacement (`TRUE`) or not (`FALSE`)
# ^   * `prob` - a vector of probabilities for the selection of each element of `x`. 
# ^      If probabilities aren't specified here, then the elements of `x` are assumed 
# ^      equally likely.
# ^ 
# ^ Note that the arguments `replace` and `prob` are given default values of `FALSE`
# ^ and `NULL`. This means that if we don't specify a value, R will assume they take
# ^ the defaults specified in the function definition.
# ^ 
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^



#
# Exercise:
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# * Use the `sample` function to:
#   * Take a sample of size $n=100$
#   * From a population of $[0,1]$ values
#   * With a probabilities $[0.74,0.26]$
#   * Using replacement
#   * _Hint:_ last time we saw we can use the `c` function to create vectors from two or more constants.


sample(c(0,1), 100, replace=TRUE, prob=c(0.74,0.26))











# Your code should return a vector of length 100, that will look something like the one below.
# 
# [1] 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
# [56] 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1


#
# Exercise:
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# * What do the values $0$ and $1$ represent?
# * Re-run your code from the previous exercise, but now save it as a variable `x`
# * Compute the `sum` of the elements of `x` to find out how many Black jurors would be in your simulated jury pool.
# * Are you close to the value of $8$ that was seen in the Swain case?
# * How would you modify your code to compute the proportion of Black jurors in the panel?
  

## 1= a Black juror, and 0=otherwise
x <- sample(c(0,1), 100, TRUE, c(0.74,0.26))
sum(x)
## the sum will be different for each sample, but it will be very unlikely that you get a value close to 8!









#
# 2.2 Using a function to repeat your calculations
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 
# 
# As with other programming languages (such as Python), we can combine multiple 
# commands in `R` into our own custom functions that perform more complicated tasks
# or calculations. Throughout the year, we will be writing our own functions to 
# solve specific problems and today we will learn the basic syntax of how to create
# a function.



# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
# ^ TECHNIQUE: 
# ^ 
# ^ When creating a new function, it needs to have a name, probably at least one 
# ^ argument (although it doesn’t have to), and a body of code that does something. 
# ^ At the end it usually should (although doesn’t have to) return a value or object
# ^ out of the function. 
# ^ 
# ^ The general syntax for writing your own function is
# ^ 
name.of.function <- function(arg1, arg2, arg3=2) {
  # function code to do some useful stuff
  return(something) # return value 
}
# ^ 
# ^ + name.of.function: is the function’s name. This can be any valid variable name,
# ^   but you should avoid using names that are used elsewhere in R, such as `mean`, 
# ^   `function`, `plot`, etc.
# ^ + arg1, arg2, arg3: these are the arguments of the function. You can write a 
# ^   function with any number of arguments, or none at all. Essentially, this is the
# ^   list of everything that is needed for the `name.of.function` function to run.
# ^   Some arguments have default values specified, such as `arg3` in our example, 
# ^   which is set to `2` unless otherwise specified. Arguments without a default 
# ^   must have a value supplied for the function to run. You do not need to provide
# ^   a value for those arguments with a default as they are considered as optional,
# ^   and when omitted the function will simply use the default value in its definition.
# ^ + **Function body**: The function code between the `{}` brackets is run every 
# ^   time the function is called. Note that unlike Python where the code _inside_ 
# ^   the function is _indented_, with `R` the code inside the function must be 
# ^   enclosed in curly braces `{}`. 
# ^ + **Return value**: The last line of the code is the value that will be returned
# ^   by the function.  It is not necessary that a function return anything, for 
# ^   example a function that makes a plot might not return anything (and so either 
# ^   state `return()` or omitting the `return` statement entirely), whereas a function 
# ^   that does a mathematical operation might return a number, or a vector.
# ^
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


# For example, we can write a function to compute the sum of squares of two numbers as
sum.of.squares <- function(x,y) {
  return(x^2 + y^2)
}

# and we can then evaluate

sum.of.squares(3,4)


#
# Exercise:
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# * Write a function called `simulatePanel` which has no arguments, simulates a 
#   100 person jury panel, and returns the number of Black jurors it contains.
#

"simulatePanel" <- function(){
  x <- sample(c(0,1), 100, TRUE, c(0.74,0.26))
  return(sum(x))
}















# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
# ^ TECHNIQUE: 
# ^ 
# ^ `replicate` is a function that repeatedly executes a fragment of code (an 
# ^ *expression*) a certain number of times. The function and the number of times
# ^ its called are its two arguments:
# ^   
# ^ `replicate(n, expr)`
# ^ 
# ^ evaluates the code `expr` repeatedly `n` times. For example, the following line
# ^ of code will print `"Hello World"` to the console ten times:
# ^   
    replicate(10, print("Hello world"))
# ^ 
# ^ If the expression `expr` returns a value, then `replicate` combines the results
# ^ together and returns them as a single object. 
# ^ 
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^



#
# Exercise:
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# * Use `replicate` with your `simulatePanel` function to simulate the number of 
#   Black jurors on 5000 simulated jury panels. Save the results to a variable 
#   called `panels`.
# * What does each number in the vector `panels` represent?
# * Draw a `hist`ogram of `panels` - how does this compare to the observation of $x=8$?

    
panels <- replicate(5000, simulatePanel())
ist(panels)
# x=8 was off the bottom of my histogram - so it doesn't look very likely 
    








#
# 2.3 Using a binomial distribution
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 
# 
# A different (and simpler) way of viewing this problem is to recognise that we 
# have  all of the conditions for a binomial distribution here. If we let the
# number of Black jurors on the 100-person panel be $X$, then if we're sampling 
# independently and randomly with fixed $p=0.26$, then we should have that 
# X ~ Bin(100, 0.26).
# 
# As you might expect from statistical software, R can directly generate random 
# numbers from common distributions such as the binomial.

# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
# ^ TECHNIQUE: 
# ^
# ^ The `rbinom` function allows us to generate random observations from a 
# ^ binomial distribution. Its syntax is
# ^ 
# ^ rbinom(n, size, prob)
# ^ 
# ^ The arguments to this function are:
# ^   
# ^  * n - how many random numbers to generate. Note this is not the binomial sample size parameter n!
# ^  * size - the $n$ parameter of the binomial distribution to use
# ^  * prob - the probability of success p.
# ^ 
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    

#
# Exercise:
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# * How would you use the `rbinom` function to simulate $X$, the number of Black 
#    jurors in a jury panel of 100 individuals?
# * How would you modify your code to simulate 5000 values of $X$? 

    
    
rbinom(1, 100, 0.26)

panels <- rbinom(5000, 100, 0.26)
    
    
    
    
    
    
#
# 2.4 Exploring the results
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#      
# We've now randomly simulated a large number of potential jury panels consistent 
# with this area in Alabama. Let's do a little statistical analysis on our results.
# You can use either the results from your own function or `rbinom` - it shouldn't
# matter which.

#
# Exercise:
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# * Compute the `mean` and `var`iance of your simulated Xs.
# * If X ~ Bin(100, 0.26) what are the theoretical mean and variance of X? 
#     Do these values agree with your simulations?
# * Does the simulated distribution of X the values appear to be consistent 
#    with the observation x=8?




mean(panels)
var(panels)
## For X ~ Bin(n,p), we would expect a mean of np and variance of np(1-p)
100*0.26 # theoretical mean is 26
100*0.26*0.74 # and variance is 19.26
## Depending on your sample, you'll likely be reasonably close to the theory with the sample mean and variance

## there are various ways to answer the final question. One is to see how many standard deviations x=8 is from the
## mean of the distribution
(8-mean(panels))/sd(panels)
## I got 4, which would suggest x=8 is particularly unlikely if this were a distribution like a Normal.
##
## More specifically, you could use the Normal distribution and directly compute the probability.
## For me, I got a probability of 0.00002 of observing X<=8 - again this seems very unlikely

    
 
    
       

    
#
# Exercise:
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~    
#
# * What distribution would make a good approximation to that of X? Hint:
# we're summing a large number of independent random variables.
# * Re-draw/go back to your`hist`ogram of the values of $X$. Does the shape of 
# the histogram agree with your expectation?

    
    
    
# CLT (or normal approximation to binomial) => we'd expect a Normal distribution
hist(panels)
# This looks pretty Normally distributed to me

    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
# Let's add the observed value of x=8 for reference. To do this, we will likely 
# need to modify our x-axis to have a larger range to ensure that 8 is visible 
# within the plot range, and learn how to add lines to an existing plot.

# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
# ^ TECHNIQUE: 
# ^
# ^ To control the ranges of the horizontal and vertical axes, we can add the 
# ^ xlim and ylim arguments to our original plotting command. To set the horizontal
# ^ axis limits, we pass a vector of two numbers to represent the lower and upper
# ^ limits, xlim = c(lower, upper), and repeat the same for `ylim` to customise
# ^ the vertical axis. For example,
# ^ 
    plot(x=1:10, y=1:10, xlim=c(-10,10), ylim=c(0,20))
# ^ 
# ^ We don't have to specify axis limits, and when omitted R will figure out something 
# ^ sensible for us.
# ^  
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    

#
# Exercise:
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~    
#
# * Re-draw your histogram using $x$ axis limits that go from 0 up to 50.

    
hist(panels, xlim=c(0,50))
    
    
    
    
    
    
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
# ^ TECHNIQUE: 
# ^
# ^ It is often useful to add simple straight lines to lines to plots, which can be
# ^ achieved using the `abline` function. `abline` can be used in three different ways:
# ^   
# ^   + Draw a horizontal line: pass a value to the `h` argument, `abline(h=3)` draws
# ^     a horizontal line at y=3
# ^   + Draw a vertical line: pass a value to the `v` argument, `abline(v=5)` draws
# ^     a vertical line at x=5
# ^   + Draw a line with given intercept and slope: pass value to the `a` and `b` 
# ^     arguments representing the intercept and slope respectively; `abline(a=1,b=2)` 
# ^     draws the line at y=1+2x
# ^   
# ^ `abline` can be customised using any of the usual colour and line modifications 
# ^ using colour, line types and widths .
# ^ 
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^



    
#
# Exercise:
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~    
#
# * Add a vertical line at $x=8$ to represent the observation in the Swain jury
#     selection case.
# * You can also customise your axis labels to be more readable - see the online help
#     for details.
# * You can customise your line (and your histogram) using colour:
# * Read the online help page on using colour in plots and experiment with redrawing
#     your histogram and vertical line using some custom colour.
# * What do you conclude about the plausibility of observing $x=8$ at random from
#     this population?



abline(v=8,col='red')
## x=8 appears to be far out in the tail of the distribution, which agrees with our previous statements.

    
    
    
    
    


# You should end up with a plot that looks a little like the one on the webpage.

#
# Exercise:
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~    
#
# * Without using the normal distribution, how would you use your simulations to estimate P[X <= 8]?
#   * *Hints*:
#   * Think about how you might determine how many of your simulated jury panels have 8 or fewer Black jurors?
#   * You can use the `<=` operator to test every element of a vector.
#   * `sum` will treat all the values of `TRUE` in a vector as `1` and `FALSE` as `0`
#   * You may need to make many more simulations to get a non-zero estimate.
#   * Ask for help if you're stuck!
#

    
    
panels<=8 ## this gives me a load of FALSE/TRUE values
sum(panels<=8) ## sum will "add up" the values with FALSE=0 and TRUE=1
## this gave me zero, so let's increase the number of simulations to a million!
sum(rbinom(1e6, 100, 0.26)<=8)
# this gave me 3, so our estimate for the probability would be
3/1e6    
# you will need even more simulations to produce a reliable estimate of this probability
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    


# This is evidence that the model of random selection of the jurors in the panel
# is not consistent with the data from the panel. While it is possible that the 
# panel could have been generated by chance, our simulation demonstrates that it
# is hugely unlikely.
# 
# The reality of the trial panel is very much at odds with the model’s assumption
# of random selection from the eligible population. When the data and a model are
# inconsistent, then the model is hard to justify. After all, the data are real 
# but the model is just a set of assumptions. When assumptions are at odds with 
# reality, we must question those assumptions.
# 
# Therefore the most reasonable conclusion is that the either the proportion of 
# eligible Black jurors was far smaller than stated or the assumption of random 
# selection is unjustified for this jury panel. As the proportion was not in doubt,
# the most reasonable conclusion is that the jury panel was not selected by random
# sampling from the population of eligible jurors. Notwithstanding the opinion of 
# the Supreme Court, the difference between 26% and 8% is not so small as to be 
# explained well by chance alone.




#
#
# 3. Further Exercises:
# ==================================================================================
#
# Exercise:
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~    
#
# * How would you use the techniques above to simulate the selection (without 
#   replacement) of 10 trial jurors from the 100-person jury panel? Do your results
#   indicate whether it is plausible to obtain no Black jurors purely at random?
# * Link up your two simulations! First simulate the selection of a representative
#   100-person panel using `rbinom`, and then use your simulated panel to `sample`
#   a simulated trial jury without replacement. Revisit your analysis to see 
#   whether this affects your conclusions.
