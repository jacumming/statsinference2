# PRACTICAL 1-1: Introduction to R
# ---------------------------------
#
#
# This practical will introduce you to working with `R` as a statistical programming
# and analysis language, as well as going through the basics of how to use the `RStudio`
# editor which is a convenient and helpful interface to `R`.

# You will be familiar with the basics of programming with Python, but there are 
# some important differences between R and Python. Additionally, R has a lot more 
# support for statistics in terms of the functions, data plotting, and packages that
# are available. 

# If you're also taking Data Science & Statistical Computing 2, then you may 
# already be familiar with much of this introductory material - feel free to skip
# over sections that you already know and have a go at the 'Additional Exercises'
# at the end.

  
# New R techniques:
#   *   Basic R skills with arithmetic, functions, etc
#   *   Manipulating and creating vectors: `c`, `seq`, 
#   *   Calculating data summaries: `mean`, `sd`, `var`, `min`, `max`
#   *   Plotting a scatterplot with `plot`, a histogram with `hist`, and a boxplot with `boxplot`.
#   *   Customising plots with labels, titles, colour, etc.


#
#
# 1. Getting Started
# ==================================================================================
#
# _R_ is an open source programming language for statistical computing and graphics that is widely 
# used among statisticians for data analysis.   As _R_ is a programming language and not a program 
# itself (like Excel) we will need some programming skills ,as even the simplest data analysis will 
# require writing and evaluating small fragments of code to carry out the analysis we require. To 
# make life easier,  we will be using _RStudio_ as an interface to write, edit, and evaluate our _R_
# code.

#
# 1.1 RStudio
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Hopefully you will have installed your own copy of _R_ and _RStudio_, or have 
# opened it using the AppHub or _AppsAnywhere_. If not, check the instructions 
# on the webpage.

#
# Exercise:
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# * Launch RStudio! (We won't be using the _R_ program directly; RStudio will take 
#   care of that for us)
# * Download the Practical Script file by Right-clicking on the link on the workshet
#   and saving the file to somewhere accessible. The script file contains the same 
#   practical instructions as this webpage, but in a form that is viewable and 
#   editable as an `R` file.
# * Now open the script file in RStudio, either by going File > Open and selecting
#   the file, or by dragging and dropping the file into Rstudio.

# You'll now see that the default RStudio environment is divided in 4 panels, with
# the default arrangement illustrated below. Going anticlockwise, the four panels
# are: Code; Console; Plots, Help, and Files; and Workspace and History.
                   
# If you want to rearrange which panes go where, go to the Options dialog 
# **Tools > Options** menu on Windows (**RStudio > Preferences** on a Mac). 
# You'll find a 'Panes' tab where you can rearrange the layout to your preference.


# CODE EDITOR -- the main editor for your _R_ code. This should contain the practical script file that 
#       you have just downloaded and opened. This pane is hidden at first, however when you load or 
#       start a new _R_ script file it will be displayed.  R code can be entered here, and it provides 
#       support such as auto-complete using [Tab], colour highlighting, and additional buttons and menu
#       items to help edit and evaluate your code. In particular, a single line of code (or any selected
#       block of code) can be evaluated in one go by typing [Ctrl]+[Enter], and the whole file can be 
#       evaluated with [Ctrl]+[Shift]+[S].

# R CONSOLE -- this pane is where your code from the Editor is evaluated by _R_. You can also use the 
#       console here to execute quick calculations that you don't need to save. 
#       Commands entered in the *Console* tab are immediately executed by _R_, and the results displayed 
#       on the following line. In this way, _R_ can be used as a simple calculator by typing directly 
#       into the *Console* window. However, for more complex calculations with many steps it is preferable
#       to write the code in a script file using the *Code* pane first, and then evaluate it in the 
#       *Console*. 
#       Note: when in the *Console* pane, you can use the [up arrow] and [down arrow] keys to navigate 
#       through previous commands (e.g. to correct mistakes).

# PLOTS, HELP, and FILES -- this pane has multiple roles indicated by the tabs along its top. The *Plots*
#       tab will show the results of any plots you produce in _R_. The *Help* tab is where RStudio will
#       display any help files. The *Files* tab provides a simple file viewer to quickly navigate between
#       and open files.

# WORKSPACE and HISTORY -- this pane has two functions, also indicated by tabs. The *Workspace* (or 
#       Environment) tab lists all the variables you have currently available in this session of R, along
#       with their types and values. The *History* tab shows a list of all the _R_ commands you have 
#       evaluated in the console.

# For more detailed help on the RStudio programming environment, see the RStudio  cheatsheet at 
# https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/rstudio-IDE-cheatsheet.pdf


# 1.2 First Steps
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# When we just want to do small and quick calculations, we can type R commands directly into the console
# window. These commands will be evaluated immediately and the answer returned on the next line.

#Let's try some simple arithmetic:

# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
# ^ TECHNIQUE: 
# ^ 
# ^ At the `>` prompt in the console you can type numerical expressions as you would into a calculator,
# ^ hit <Enter> and `R` will print the answer. 
# ^ 
# ^ _R_ can be used as a calculator to perform the usual simple arithmetic operations. The operators are: 
# ^ 
# ^     +  addition
# ^     -  subtraction
# ^     *  multiplication
# ^     /  division
# ^     ^  raise to the power (alternatively `**` also works)
# ^    %%  modulus, e.g. 5 %% 3 is 2
# ^   %/% integer division, e.g. 5 %/% 3 is 1
# ^ 
# ^ Many standard mathematical functions are also available:
# ^   
# ^   abs(x) - the absolute value of x
# ^  sqrt(x) - the square root of x
# ^   log(x) - the natural logarithm of x (use `log10` for base-10)
# ^   exp(x) - the exponential of x, i.e. e^x.
# ^   sin(x), cos(x), tan(x) - the sine, cosine, and tangent
# ^ 
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


#
# Exercise:
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#  Experiment using the R Console to evaluate simple arithmetic expressions. 
#  For example, find the sum and difference of 45.23 and 3.59, and the square root of 7.
#
#  When you're comfortable with how simple commands work, proceed to the next question.
#











# When we want to save the code for our calculations or the calculation is long and requires many steps,
# its better to write the code in a script file in the Editor pane. Then, when the code is ready, we can
# evaluate it either line-by-line, or all in one go.


#
# Exercise:
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#  * Use the gap below to write the `R` command to find the sum from i=1 to 5 of i^i.
#  * There are many ways to evaluate the code. Rather than re-typing in the console, or copy/pasting
#    the code, `RStudio` gives us some shortcuts.
#  * First, position the text cursor on the line with the code and:
#    * Click the `Run` button at the top of the Editor window to execute the current line
#    * Move the cursor back to the line of code and press `[Ctrl]+[Enter]`











# In both cases, the line of code is copied to the console and evaluated, and the cursor advances to the
# next line of executable code. Pressing [Ctrl]+[Enter] will step through your code one line at a time,
# which is useful to find any bugs. Alternatively, to run multiple lines at once simply highlight the
# lines you want to run and click `Run` or press [Ctrl]+[Enter]. We can also save and evaluate an entire
# script file by pressing [Ctrl]+[Shift]+[S]. This is useful when you've finished a long calculation and
# don't want to step through it line-by-line.






#
#
# 2.  Variables and Vectors
# ==================================================================================

# During an R session we work with and create variables. Variables can be a scalars, vectors, matrices,
# functions, or lists. In order to create a new object we use the assign symbol `<-`, although one can 
# often use `=` instead. For example, to create the object `a` with a value of 2 we can type:

a <- 2

# or

a = 2

# R has many variables and functions available by default, and many many more that can be downloaded 
# using special libraries. 

# For each of these standard objects R provides online help, which can be dislpayed in the Help window. 
# To access this help type `?` followed immediately by the name of the object in question. 

#
# Exercise:
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#  * R stores the value of pi (3.141593) in a constant called `pi`.
#  * Display the value of pi by typing and evaluating `pi` in the console.
#  * Use the `?` to bring up the help for `pi` (you don't need to read it)
#








# Vectors are the most basic type of variable in R, and all numerical variables are created as vectors -
# even scalars are vectors of length 1. Formally, `R` stores a vector as an ordered list numbers, and 
# `R` contains many linear algebra tools that allow us to perform basic vector calculus (one of the 
# many reasons why `R` is preferred to Excel). 
# 
# The object you have just created, `a`, is a vector of length 1. When you type `a` and press `[Enter]`
# you will see the following output (without the `#`):

# [1] 2

# The [1] is a number indicating which element of the vector starts the current line. In this example this
# is unnecessary as we only have a vector of length one. However, if we consider a bigger vector, such as
# the integers from 1 to 50:

# [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23
# [24] 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46
# [47] 47 48 49 50

# we can see that the vector covers multiple lines, the second line begins with element 24 of the vector, and 
# the final line begins at element 47.


# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
# ^ TECHNIQUE: 
# ^ 
# ^  The most basic way to create a vector is to use th `c` function to '`c`ombine' several values
# ^ of the same type into a vector. For example,
# ^ 
# ^ x <- c(1,2,3)
# ^ 
# ^ _R_ provides some simple functions for quickly creating numerical vectors.
# ^ 
# ^ We can use the colon `:` operator to create integer sequences between two values and return the
# ^ result as a vector:
# ^
# ^ y <- 1:10
# ^ 
# ^ Vectors can also be combined together with the `c` function:
# ^   
# ^ z <- c(x,y)
# ^ 
# ^ The `seq` function also generates a vector containing a sequence between its two arguments `from`
# and `to`, but is more sophisticated than `:`. We can dictate the length of the sequence by supplying
# ^ the optional `length` argument, or the step size in the sequence by passing a value to the `by` 
# ^ argument. If we supply neither `length` nor `by`, then `seq` gives an integer sequence like `:`.
# ^ 
# ^ y <- seq(1,9) ## same as 1:9
# ^ 
# ^ seq(1,10,length=25) ## sequence of given length
# ^ 
# ^ seq(15,45,by=3) ## sequence of given step
# ^ 
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


#
# Exercise:
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# Using the techniques above:
#   
# * Create the vector (2, 4, 6) in `R` and call it `v1`. 
# * Create the same vector using the object `a` that you defined before, and without typing the
#   numbers 4 or 6. _Hint_: multiplication also works for vectors.
# * Create a vector containing all of the integers from 1 to 100.
# * Create a vector containing the sequence of odd numbers between 0 and 100.
# * Create a vector containing your forename, middle names (if any), and surname as a string.
#   Hint: A string is simply some text surrounded by the quotation marks "text" or 'text'.














# Assigning names to the objects you create is very important so that they can be re-used. To edit
# or repeat previous commands in the console, we can simply press the [up arrow] and the [down arrow] keys
# to navigate through previous commands (e.g. to correct mistakes).  However, it is often much easier to
# use the Editor, rather than the console, to debug any problems.




#
# 3.  The `durham` library
# ==================================================================================
# 
#
# If you're using your own computer, then follow the installation instructions on
# the worksheet to install a copy of the `durham` package.

# If you're using a University computer, then the package should be installed on 
# the network but you need to complete the following steps to recognise it:
  
#  * Open the Windows File Explorer
#  * Then navigate "Computer" -> T: -> MATHS -> R
#  * Double-click "Setup R for Maths"
#  * If you already have R or Rstudio open, you should now close it and reopen it.

#  **Note:** You will only need to do this once, and you will not need to do this 
#     if you are running R on your own computer. 

# Now, to load the `durham` libarary, we use the `library` function and specify the library we want:

library(durham)

# There are many datasets in this library - to see names of them all type 

data(package ='durham')

# For the rest of this practical, we’ll be working with the dataset called `hospital`. To load a 
# particular data set from a package that we have alreaded loaded with `library`, we use the `data` function:

data(hospital)

# You should now view the data either in the console by typing

hospital


# or to show it in a spreadsheet layout use the `View` function:

View(hospital)

# Have a look at the help page using `?`  to learn about this data set. 


# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
# ^ IF YOU HAVE PROBLEMS WITH THE LIBRARY
# ^ 
# ^ If you have problems with any of the above steps, then you can use the link on 
# ^ the worksheet to download the data directly without the library.
# ^ 
# ^ Download the data from the link. Then you can load the file by any of the 
# ^ following methods:
# ^   
# ^   * dragging and dropping it into the R console panel of Rstudio
# ^   * locating it using the Files panel of Rstudio and clicking
# ^   * or with the `load` function by specifying the file location.
# ^ 
# ^ This will create the `hospital` data set object in R for you to use in the 
# ^ following. 
# ^ 
# ^ Note that the help function (`?`) will not work with data loaded in this way.
# ^ 
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^



#
# 4.  Data frames
# ==================================================================================
# 

# A _data frame_ which is a two-dimensional table of data (like a matrix) where each column contains
# values of one variable, and each row contains one set of values from each observation. Each column
# is labelled with a variable name, and the values within each column must be of the same type but the
# types of data held in each column can differ according to the type of variable it represents. The data
# set `hospital` that we have just loaded is a data frame.
# 
# The rows and columns of data frames can be extracted as vectors allowing us to easily perform calculations
# of summary statistics, for example. In the `hospital` data, we see that the data contains 3 columns each
# with different names.


# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
# ^ TECHNIQUE: 
# ^ 
# ^ We can  extract individual columns from a data frame by using the variable name and the dollar-sign `$`.
# ^ For example, to extract the `beds` column from `hospital` we would type:
# ^   
# ^ hospital$beds
# ^ 
# ^ We can extract a vector containing all of the column names for a given data frame using the `names` function:
# ^   
# ^ names(hospital)
# ^ 
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


#
# Exercise:
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# 
#  * Use the `names` function to extract the names of the variables in the hospital data.
#  * Create new vectors called `beds` and `discs` containing the data for the number of beds, and number of discharges in the hospital data respectively. 
#  * Compute the mean, standard deviation and range of the discharges data.














# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
# ^ TECHNIQUE: 
# ^ 
# ^ When a vector represents numerical data, there are a number of standard functions that will be
# ^ useful for any statistical calculations:
# ^   
# ^  `sum` - sums all values in the vector
# ^  `mean` - computes the sample mean, i.e. 1/n \sum_{i=1}^n x_i
# ^  `median` - computes the sample median value
# ^  `min` and `max` - compute the sample minimum and maximum
# ^  `range` - computes the sample range, i.e. the difference between the max and min value
# ^  `var` and `sd` - compute the _sample_ variance and standard deviation, i.e. 
# ^                   s^2= 1/(n-1) \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-xbar)^2
# ^  `quantile` - computes the min, max, median, and lower and upper quartiles. Other quantiles can
# ^               be computed using the `probs` argument
# ^  `summary` - calculates the min, max, mean, median, and quantiles.
# ^  
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^                  ```
                  


#
# Exercise:
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# 
# * Compute the mean, standard deviation and range of the discharges data.












#
# 5. Simple plots
# ==================================================================================
# 
# One of `R`’s greatest strengths is the facility it provides for producing attractive graphics.
# In the following tasks we will use some of the key plotting tools to study the `hospital` data.
#
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
# ^ TECHNIQUE: 
# ^ 
# ^ The `plot` function produces a scatterplot of its two arguments. Suppose we have saved our x
# ^ coordinates in a vector `a`, and our y coordinates in a vector `b`, then to draw a scatterplot
# ^ of (x,y) we type
# ^ 
# ^   plot(x=a, y=b)
# ^ 
# ^ If the argument labels `x` and `y` are not supplied, _R_ will assume the first argument is `x`
# ^ and the second is `y`. If only one vector of data is supplied, this will be taken as the y value
# ^ and will be plotted against the integers `1:length(y)`, i.e. in the sequence in which they appear
# ^ in the data.
# ^ 
# ^ All of the standard plot functions can be customised by passing additional arguments to the function.
# ^ For instance, we can add a plot title and axis labels by supplying optional arguments:
# ^ 
# ^    `main` - provides a title to display at the top of the plot 
# ^    `xlab` - provides a label for the horizontal axis
# ^    `ylab` - provides a label for the vertical axis
# ^                   
# ^  For example,
# ^ 
# ^  plot(x=a,y=b, xlab='A', ylab='B', main='Plot of B vs A')
# ^ 
# ^ *Note*: Once a plot has been drawn, it is not possible to erase any features from it, we can only add
# ^   extra lines or points to it. So, if you make a mistake drawing your plot then you'll need to start 
# ^   over with a fresh one by calling `plot` again.
# ^ 
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


#
# Exercise:
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# 
#   * Produce a scatter-plot of discharges (vertically) against beds (horizontally) using `plot`.
#     The scatterplot will appear in the 'Plots' sub-window.
#   * Redraw the plot, labelling the axes `Beds` and `Discharges`.
#   * What do you notice about the relationship?












                  
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
# ^ TECHNIQUE: 
# ^ 
# ^ A histogram(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram) consists of parallel vertical bars that 
# ^ graphically shows the frequency distribution of a quantitative variable. The area of each bar
# ^ is proportional to the frequency of items found in each class. To plot a histogram, we use the
# ^ `hist` function and apply it to a single vector of data
# ^     
# ^     hist(x)
# ^     
# ^ As with `plot`, we can use `main` and `xlab` to set the plot title and horizontal axis label.
# ^     
# ^ Histogram also takes a number of arguments specific to the plotting of histograms:
# ^     
# ^   `breaks` - allows us to control the number of bars in the histogram. If `breaks` is set to a 
# ^             single number, this will be used to (suggest) the number of bars in the histogram. 
# ^             If `breaks` is set to a vector, the values will be used to indicate the endpoints 
# ^             of the bars of the histogram. _Note_: `R` interprets this number as a suggestion only.
# ^ 
# ^   `freq` - if `TRUE` the histogram shows the simple frequencies or counts within each bar; if 
# ^           `FALSE` then the histogram shows probability densities rather than counts.
# ^                   
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


#
# Exercise:
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# 
#   * Produce a histogram of `discharges` from the `hospital` data.
#   * Produce a histogram of the `beds` data. What do you notice about the two variables?
#   * Increase the number of bars in the discharges histogram. Does this change your perception
#     of the distribution of the discharges data. How about if you decrease the number of bars?















# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
# ^ TECHNIQUE: 
# ^ 
# ^ A boxplot provides a graphical view of the median, quartiles, maximum, and minimum of a data set. 
# ^ A box plot is a bit like a histogram seen from above. The full name is 'box and whisker' plot. 
# ^ The 'box' shows the middle 50% of the observations, from the first to the third quartile. Inside
# ^ the box, the line shows the median (which is the second quartile). The 'whiskers' show the full 
# ^ range of the data, although in `R` there is the possibility of excluding outliers, which appear 
# ^ as individual points.
# ^ 
# ^ To draw a boxplot of a single variable we simply pass the data directly to the `boxplot` function:
# ^ 
# ^   boxplot(x)
# ^ 
# ^ To draw multiple boxplots within the same plot, we can pass multiple vectors separated by commas
# ^ as arguments (e.g. `boxplot(x,y,z)`). We can even pass an entire dataframe to the boxplot function,
# ^ and it will draw boxplots of all the columns within a single plot.
# ^ 
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


#
# Exercise:
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# 
# * Draw a boxplot of the discharges data. Compare this to the Histogram of discharges.
# * Draw a boxplot of the beds and discharges data on the same y-axis using the boxplot function only once.
















#
# 6. Advanced plots
# ==================================================================================
# 
# When performing a statistical analysis it is important that you make your graphics informative as
# possible. This will aid you, as the statistician, in spotting relation- ships and performing the 
# analysis, and will aid those to whom the analysis is going to be communicated. Often this involves 
# adding simple things like colour or tweak- ing some of the default settings of the plotting region. 
# In other cases we might plot things together to facilitate easy comparison. We’ll now explore some 
# simple ways of improving the plots we constructed earlier.

#
# Exercise:
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# 
# * Read the linked help pages below and experiment with customising your plots.
# * Read the page on using colour in plot and experiment with redrawing your scatterplot using 
#   colour for the points.
#      http://www.maths.dur.ac.uk/stats/people/jac/sc2-practicals/r_8_advplots.html#col 
# * Now try  changing the plot symbols to something that you think looks best.
#       http://www.maths.dur.ac.uk/stats/people/jac/sc2-practicals/r_8_advplots.html#pch 
# * Read up about using the `par` function to [combine multiple plots](r_7_plots.html#par-mfrow).
#       http://www.maths.dur.ac.uk/stats/people/jac/sc2-practicals/r_7_plots.html#par-mfrow 
# * Divide the plotting region into two panes (one on top of the other).
# * Now redraw the histogram of discharges above of the histogram of beds from the `hospital` data.
# Does this make comparison of the distributions easier?












#
# 7. Additional exercises
# ==================================================================================
# 
# How long is a movie?
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Multivariate statistics inevitably involves working with large data sets. The effort 
# involved in preparing and making a large dataset usable for analysis should not 
# be underestimated, but thankfully we're going to look at a dataset that has been 
# "prepared earlier". This `movies` data set is reasonably large(ish), containing 
# 24 different attributes of 28819 movies gathered from [IMDB](http://imdb.com). 
# One of the variables is the movie length in minutes, and it is interesting to 
# look at this variable in some detail.

# In this exercise we'll use the basic techniques above to investigate the behaviour
# of the data, and see if we can find (and explain) any interesting features. This
# process is known as *data exploration* or *exploratory analysis*, and is usually
# the precursor to more formal statistical analyses.


# Exercise:
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# 
# * Download the data from the link on the worksheet above. Then either load the file
#   one of the following methods:
#    * dragging and dropping it into the R console panel of Rstudio
#    * locating it using the Files panel of Rstudio and clicking
#    * or with the `load` function by specifying the file location.
# * Draw a histogram of the `length` variable.
# * What features can you see? 
#   * Sometimes it can be useful to expose where exactly the data values are within
#     the bars of the histogram. For this, we can use a *rugplot* using the `rug` 
#     function. Add a rugplot to the histogram - what problems does this highlight?
#   * Let's try a boxplot of the data - do we learn anything more?
# * Are there any moview which differ substantially from all the others  (potential *outliers*)?


# Clearly, our data are distorted by some particularly unusal movies. Let's look at these a little more closely.


# Exercise:
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# 
# * What are the lengths of the two longest movies? 
# * Do the lengths of these movies seem sensible?











# Although it's tempting to dismiss these as simple errors, we should always check
# our data carefully before dismissing it.

# Exercise:

# 
# * Extract the subset of the dataframe containing all the variables for both of 
#   these movies
#  * Inspect the variable values:
#    * The variables `r1` to `r10` give the percentage of reviews which rated the
#      movie as a `1` up to a `10` out of `10`. Are these movies particularly popular?
#    * What are the names of the movies? Do a quick Google search to see if you 
#      can find out more.
















# Incidentally, this data set is no longer up-to-date and there are some even longer
# films now (though it remains a mystery why.)

# Clearly, the extreme values are not representative of most movies (potential 
# *outliers*) and so - for not - let's ignore them. For exploring the main distribution 
# of movie lengths it makes sense to set some kind of upper limit. Over 99% of the
# data are less than three hours in length, so let's restrict ourselve to those.

# Exercise:
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# 
# * Extract the all the movies of length *at most* three hours.
# * Draw a histogram - what do you find?


# Useful context:
#   * The Oscars define a "short film" as anything under 40 minutes.
#   * Animated shorts are typically between 5 and 8 minutes long, and are counted 
#     as individual movies (so, e.g., every 'Tom and Jerry' or 'Mickey Mouse' 
#     cartoon has its own entry).

# Exercise:
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# 
# * Redraw your histogram using a bar-width of 1 minute (you may need to enlarge your plot window).
# * What do you see? How does the information above help explain the data?
