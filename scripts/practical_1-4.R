# PRACTICAL 1-4: Bayesian analysis of Poisson data'
# ---------------------------------
#
#
# In this practical we use R to investigate the conjugate Bayesian analysis for 
# Poisson data. We will also investigate using the effects of the prior distribution 
# on the posterior, and the situation where our sample size grows large.
#
#
# *  You will need the following skills from previous practicals:
#   *   Creating vectors with `seq`
#   *   Drawing a plot of a known function using `curve`
#   *   Using additional graphical parameters to customise plots with colour (`col`),
#       line type (`lty`), axis range (`xlim` and `ylim`) etc
#   *   Adding simple straight lines to plots with `abline`
#   *   Writing your own functions with `function`
# 
# *  New R techniques:
#   *   Using `plot` to draw plots of general data, and `lines` and `point` to add
#       additional data
#   *   Using R's built-in functions to evaluate a standard pdf, e.g. `dgamma` and `dnorm`
#   *   Using the quantile functions, e.g. `qgamma`, to produce exact credible intervals
#       using standard distributions 
#   *   Using `sapply` to evaluate a function with different arguments specified by
#       the element of a vector



#
#
# 1. The Data
# ==================================================================================
#
# 
# Our dataset concerns the number of volcanoes that erupted each year from 2000 to 
# 2018, taken from here - https://volcano.si.edu/faq/index.cfm?question=eruptionsbyyear. 
# The data are given in the table below, where each volcanic eruption is counted in
# the year that the eruption started. Volcanic eruptions are split into groups 
# depending on the severity of the eruption, as measured on the logarithmically-scaled
# _Volcanic Explosivity Index_ (VEI). For example, the 2010 eruption of Eyjafjallajökull
# in Iceland had a VEI of 4, whereas the eruption of Krakatoa in 1883 was VEI6. 
#
# The eruptions are loosely classified as `Small` (VEI$\leq 2$), `Medium` ($2<$ VEI $<4$),
# and `Large` (VEI $\geq 4$).


#
# Exercise:
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# * Run the `R` code below to input the data, and create a new data frame called 
#   `volcano`, with columns `Year`, `Small`, `Medium`, and `Large`.


volcano <- data.frame(Year = 2000:2018, 
           Small = c(30, 25, 30, 32, 29, 29, 34, 29, 25, 28, 39, 30, 
                     40, 40, 41, 26, 37, 30, 34), 
           Medium = c(6, 6, 5, 5, 8, 4, 3, 3, 7, 2, 6, 6, 4, 7, 7, 
                      5, 4, 6, 4),
           Large = c(0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 3, 0, 1, 0, 1, 
                     0, 2, 0, 1))



# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
# ^ TECHNIQUE: 
# ^ 
# ^ **Plot, points, and lines**
# ^   
# ^ The `plot` function produces a scatterplot of its two arguments. Suppose we have
# ^ saved our $x$ coordinates in a vector `a`, and our $y$ coordinates in a vector 
# ^ `b`, then to draw a scatterplot of $(x,y)$ we type
# ^ 
# ^ `plot(x=a, y=b)`
# ^ 
# ^ If the argument labels `x` and `y` are not supplied, _R_ will assume the first 
# ^ argument is `x` and the second is `y`. If only one vector of data is supplied, 
# ^ this will be taken as the $y$ value and will be plotted against the integers 
# ^ `1:length(y)`, i.e. in the sequence in which they appear in the data.
# ^ 
# ^ All of the standard plot functions can be customised by passing additional 
# ^ arguments to the function. For instance, we can add a plot title and axis labels
# ^ by supplying optional arguments:
# ^ 
# ^ + `type` - determines the type of plot to draw. Possible types are:
# ^     * "p" for **p**oints
# ^     * "l" for **l**ines
# ^     * "b" for **b**oth (points connected by lines)
# ^     * "h" for **h**istogram-like vertical lines
# ^     * "s" for **s**tep lines
# ^ + `xlab`, `ylab` - provides a label for the horizontal and vertical axes
# ^ + `xlim`, `ylim` - allows for specification of a minimum and maximum value of the
# ^     corresponding axis limits, e.g. `xlim=c(0,10)` will set the horizontal axis 
# ^     limits to be $[0,10]$.
# ^ + `col` - can be specified to [use colour](r_8_advplots.html#col) for drawing
# ^ 
# ^ For example,
# ^ 
# ^ `plot(x=-10:10,y=sin((-10:10)/(2*pi)), type="b", xlab='A', ylim=c(-1.5,1))`
# ^ 
# ^ *Note*: Once a plot has been drawn, it is not possible to erase any features from
# ^ it - we can only add extra lines or points to it. So, if you make a mistake 
# ^ drawing your plot then you'll need to start over with a fresh one by calling `plot`
# ^ again.
# ^ 
# ^ After creating a `plot`, we can _add_ additional points to the plot by calling the
# ^ `points` function which  draws additional points at the specified `x` and `y` values.
# ^ Similarly, the `lines` function will draw connected lines between its `x` and `y` 
# ^ arguments.
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

# 
# Exercise: 
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# * `plot` the number of `Small` eruptions against the year using a vertical axis
#   range (`ylim`) of $[0,50]$. 
# * Experiment with the plot `type`s to see how the different plots represent the
#   data.
# * Redraw the data as a `l`ine `plot`, and add `lines` of different colours to the
#   same plot for the other two groups of eruptions. 
# * Do you see any apparent relationship between time and number of eruptions?












# 
# Exercise: 
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# * Now  plot the `hist`ogram of the number of `Medium` eruptions - does it look
#   like it could follow a Poisson distribution? How else could you quickly assess this?













#
#
# 1. Conjugate analysis with the Gamma-Poisson model
# ==================================================================================
#
# 
#
# 2.1 The Theory
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 
# 
# A Poisson distribution is often used to model the counts of random events occurring
# within a fixed period of time at some rate $\lambda$. For such a random variable
# X where X ~ Po(lambda) , a Bayesian analysis will require a prior distribution for
# the unknown Poisson parameter $\lambda$. We have seen that the Gamma distribution
# provides a conjugate prior for this particular problem. Therefore, if our data 
# X1, ...,Xn are iid Po(lambda), and our prior distribution for lambda is Ga(a,b).
# Then the posterior distribution for lambda | X1,...,Xn is given by:
# 
#     lambda | X1,...,Xn ~ Ga(a+T, b+n),
# 
# where T=sum_i X_i = n Xbar.


# 2.2 The Prior
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 
# 
# First, let's use the Gamma distribution to identify an appropriate prior for our
# Poisson count data. 


# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
# ^ TECHNIQUE: 
# ^ 
# ^ **Standard density functions in R**
# ^   
# ^ `R` provides built-in functions to evaluate the PDF of standard distributions. 
# ^ The density function for a Gamma distribution $\text{Ga}(a,b)$ is used as follows
# ^ 
# ^ `dgamma(x, shape=a, rate=b)`
# ^ 
# ^ where `x` is the point (or vector of points) where we want to evaluate the PDF, and
# ^ `a` and `b` are the usual Gamma parameter values.
# ^ 
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^



# 
# Exercise: 
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# * Create a vector containing a `seq`uence of 500 equally-spaced values over the 
#   interval [0,10]. Call this `lambdavals`.
# * Evaluate the Ga(1,1) pdf at each of the values of $\lambda$ in `lambdavals`
#   using the gamma PDF `dgamma`. 
# * Make a `plot` of the pdf against lambda as a solid black line.














# An expert vulcanologist believes that the unknown rate of `Medium` eruptions, lambda,
# is such that a range of $[1,6]$ would be plausible.


# 
# Exercise: 
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# * Interpret the expert's given interval as corresponding to a statement of 
#   E(lambda) +/- 2 sd(lambda). Hence, find the mean and variance of the prior. 
# * Equate the prior mean and variance to the theoretical values for the expectation
#   (a/b) and variance (a/b^2) of a Gamma pdf, and hence find the appropriate values
#   of its parameters a and b.
# * Evaluate the expert's prior pdf for lambda at each of `lambdavals`, and save 
#   it as `cnjPrior`.
# * For plotting purposes, we need to normalise the values of `cnjPrior` so that 
#   they sum (integrate) to 1. 
#   Divide the values of `cnjPrior` by the `sum` of the values in `cnjPrior`, and 
#   replace `cnjPrior` by these normalised values.
# * Produce a fresh plot of the expert's prior pdf for $\lambda$ as a solid red curve.
#   Ensure your vertical axis covers [0,0.02]. 
# * Add a vertical red and dashed line (`abline` using the `v` argument) at the 
#   location of the prior expectation for lambda.



















# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
# ^ TECHNIQUE: 
# ^ 
# ^ **Quantiles of standard densities**
# ^   
# ^ In addition to built-in functions for PDFs of standard distributions, `R` also
# ^ provides the _quantile function_ for a pdf. The quantile function evaluates the
# ^ inverse of the cumulative distribution function, F_X^{-1}(u). Given a probability
# ^ value u in [0,1], the quantile function returns the value x of X for which
# ^ P[X <= x]=u, and so the quantile functions are particularly useful for finding 
# ^ critical values of distributions and for finding exact credible intervals.
# ^ 
# ^ The quantile function for a Gamma density X ~ Ga(a,b) is used 
# ^ as follows
# ^ 
# ^ `qgamma(alpha, shape=a, rate=b)`
# ^ 
# ^ where `alpha` is the lower tail probability (or vector of lower-tail probabilities)
# ^ for which we want the corresponding value(s) of X, and `a` and `b` are the usual
# ^ Gamma parameter values.
# ^ 
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


# 
# Exercise: 
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# * Use the `qgamma` function to find a 95% equal-tailed prior credible interval for
#   lambda using the expert's prior distribution above. 
#   _Hint:_ find the values of lambda with lower and upper tail probabilities of 2.5%.
# * How does this compare to the expert's original interval?
















# 2.3 The Likelihood
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 
# The next ingredient in the Bayesian calculation requires us to capture the 
# information contained in the data via the likelihood. In a Bayesian context, the
# likelihood is the conditional distribution of the data X1,..., Xn given the 
# parameter lambda.
# 
# Let's compute the likelihood given our data on `Medium` volcanic eruptions, and 
# add it to the plot.


# 
# Exercise: 
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# * Write a function `poisLike` that computes the Poisson likelihood for the sample 
#   of `Medium` volcano eruptions. Your function should:
#     *  Take one argument `lambda`
#     *  Compute the Poisson probability for each data point in `volcano$Medium` given
#        the value of `lambda`. 
#        _Hint_: the `dpois` function evaluates Poisson probabilities for a vector of 
#       values `x` and parameter `lambda`. Or you can use your own function from last time.
#     *  Combine the probabilities to find the likelihood of the entire sample, and `return` it.
#     * If your function is working correctly, you should agree with the output below.
#

# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
# ^ TECHNIQUE: 
# ^ 
# ^ 
# ^ **Using `sapply` to repeat calculations over a vector**
# ^   
# ^ We have seen previously that we can use the `replicate` to repeatedly call a 
# ^ function with no arguments. For functions which do take an argument, we often want
# ^ to call that function at many different values. To do this, we use `sapply` to 
# ^ apply a specified function to every element of a vector as its argument, and then
# ^ return a vector formed from the results.
# ^ 
# ^ `sapply(x, fun)`
# ^ 
# ^ applies the function `fun` to every element of the vector `x` it then returns a 
# ^ vector containing the values of `fun(x[1])`, `fun(x[2])`, and so on. So, to compute
# ^ the square-root of the integers 1 to 10, we would write
# ^ 
# ^ `sapply(1:10, FUN=sqrt)`
# ^ 
# ^ which applies the square root function to each of the integers 1 to 10.
# ^ 
# ^ There are other variations of `apply` which work with matrices and other data 
# ^ structures, and we will see those in later practicals.
# ^ 
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^



# 
# Exercise: 
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# * Use `sapply` to evaluate the Poisson likelihood (`poisLike`) for each of the 
#   values of $\lambda$ in `lambdavals`. Save this as `like`.
# * Normalise `like` so that its values sum to $1$.
# * Add the likelihood to your plot of the prior distribution as connected blue `lines`.
# * Add the maximum likelihood estimate of $\lambda$ as a vertical dashed blue line.
# * Your plot should look like the one below





























# 2.4 The Posterior
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 

We can apply Bayes rule directly, given the prior and likelihood, and numerically 
compute the posterior density for all of the values of lambda.


# 
# Exercise: 
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# * Directly compute the posterior for lambda by Bayes theorem, and save these values
#   as `postDirect`. Normalise the `postDirect` so that it sums to 1.
#   _Hint:_ Posterior is proportional to Likelihood times Prior.
# * Add the posterior to your plot as a solid green curve. 

















# However, we also know that we're using the conjugate Gamma prior with a Poisson
# likelihood, so our posterior distribution for $\lambda$ will also be a Gamma with 
# parameter values as above. Let's verify that this is the case, and add the
# resulting density function to our plot.

# 
# Exercise:
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# * Now use conjugacy to evaluate the conjugate Gamma posterior distribution.
#     * First find the posterior values of the Gamma parameters a and b, save these 
#       as `aPost` and `bPost`.
#     * Now use `dgamma` with the posterior parameter values to evaluate the posterior
#       Gamma density at each of `lambdavals`. Save these values to `postConjugate`
#       and normalise to sum to $1$.
# * Draw the conjugate posterior on your plot as a dashed `purple` curve.
# * What do you see? Do the results agree with each other? How has the prior changed?
# * Add the posterior mean as a vertical green line. 
# * What do you notice about the relationship between the posterior mean, the prior
#   mean, and the maximum likelihood estimate?


























#
# Exercise: 
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# * Use the exact Gamma posterior to find a 95\% posterior credible interval for lambda.
# * Compare the posterior interval with the prior interval you found earlier. 
#   What has changed?


















#
#
# 3.  Further Exercises: Exploring the effects of prior choice and sample size
# ==================================================================================
#
# 3.1 Changing the prior parameters
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 
# To investigate how sensitive our results are to our choices for a and b in the prior
# Gamma distribution, we're going to want to repeat our previous calculations for 
# different values of the prior parameters. To make this easier, let's wrap those 
# calculations and plots in a new function that finds and draws the Gamma posterior
# for a given prior and data set:


# 
# Exercise: 
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# * Write a function called `gammaPoisson` which:
#     * Takes four arguments: the prior Gamma parameters `a` and `b`, and the 
#       summary statistics `T` and `n`.
#     * Computes the Ga(a,b) prior and the Ga(a+T,b+n) posterior over the sequence
#       of values in `lambdavals`.
#     * Plots the (normalised) prior and posterior Gamma distributions as coloured
#       curves on one plot.
#     * Adds the MLE as a dashed vertical line.
# * Check your function by evaluating it with the values of `a`,`b`,`T`, and `n` 
#   we used for the `Medium` volcano data above.
















# 
# Exercise: 
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# * Investigate what happens as you change `a` and `b`.
#   * How does the shape of the prior change? What impact does this have on the posterior 
#     distribution?
#   * What happens for large values of `a` and `b`? How does this affect your results?

















#
# 3.2 Updating beliefs with large samples
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 
# 
# In Lecture 26, we will see that show that as the sample size grows large, the posterior
# distribution tends towards a Normal distribution and the posterior distribution becomes
# progressively less affected by the choice of prior distribution.
# 
# Let's expand our data with the records of volcanic eruptions for the entire 20th century.
# As records are slightly incomplete, only the counts of `Large` eruptions over this period 
# can be considered trustworthy. For the entire 100 years, a total of 64 `Large` 
# (VEI >= 4) eruptions were recorded


# 
# Exercise: 
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# * Combine the 20th century data with the data from 2000-2018 and compute new summary
#   statistics for the `Large` volcanic eruptions from 1900-2018. Save these as `Tbig` and `Nbig`.
# * Use a prior of $\lambda\sim\text{Ga}(2,2)$, and plot the posterior given the combined 
#   data. What happens to the posterior?

















# The large sample of data is clearly very informative for lambda, resulting in a 
# posterior distribution that is concentrated over a small range of possible lambda
# values. Let's refocus our plot on that sub-interval:

# 
# Exercise: 
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# * By modifying your Gamma-Poisson function, redraw the same plot to zoom in on the
#   interval lambda in [0.25,1.25]. 
#   Hint: you'll need to set the xlim argument to `plot` (or add it as an argument to
#   your function). 
# * What do you notice about the shape of the Gamma posterior distribution?
















#
# 3.2.1 Theory: Limiting posterior distribution
# 
# 
# If we suppose that X=(X1,...,Xn) are an i.i.d. sample of size $n$ from a 
# distribution with pdf f(x|theta) where Xi is independent of Xj given theta and 
# f(x|theta) is regular, then for n 'large enough' the posterior distribution for
# theta | x is approximately
# 
# 	f(theta | x) ~= N(thetahat, 1/I(thetahat) ),
# 
# where thetahat is the MLE of the parameter theta, and I(thetahat) is the observed
# Fisher information for a sample of size 1.
# 
# For a Poisson distribution, we have:
# 
# *   $lambdahat = (sum_i xi)/n 
# *   $L''(lambda) = - (sum_i xi)(lambda^2}.


# 
# Exercise: 
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# * Using the results above, compute the mean and variance of the limiting posterior
#   distribution for the `Large` volcano  eruption data.
# * Using `dnorm`, evaluate the Normal approximation to the posterior pdf for lambda
#   over `lambdavals`. Normalise it again to sum to one, and add it to your plot using
#   a thick dashed line.
# * Is the limiting normal distribution in agreement with the Gamma posterior? If it
#   differs, how does it differ and to what extent?
# * Do the values of the Gamma prior parameters $a$ and $b$ affect the quality of 
#   the approximation?
